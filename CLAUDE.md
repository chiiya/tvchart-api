## Project

`tvchart-api` is the **core backend and API** of a little hobby project, a tv show discovery platform.
The frontend displays all tv shows airing in a given month, and allows users to manage their individual status
(plan to watch, watching, completed, not watching). Shows that user is not interested in (not watching) can be hidden,
leading to a focused, simple grid view of all shows airing in the given month that the user is interested in.

### Data

To accomplish this, the API must be able to provide information about ALL tv shows airing at a given time. This
requires combining multiple data sources:

- TMDB: The primary data source. Changes are fetched nightly so that our database is always up to date.
- IMDB: Only used to update the IMDB score and votes count for a tv show.
- Trakt: Used for runtime, genres and trakt members (as another heuristic)
- OMDB: Used for summary and genres

All data sources except TMDB only update the records fetched from TMDB with additional information.

One big challenge is filtering the list of TV shows coming from TMDB to a reasonable list useful to most users.
Since TMDB is an international platform there are literally thousands of new TV shows coming out every month,
all around the world. Even though we provide filtering on the frontend, we cannot expect users to go through hundreds
or thousands of records to find what they're interested in. That's why we have several heuristics in place, that
whitelist or blacklist a show at import time:

- Some genres are blacklisted (e.g. reality, kids, sports, anime)
- Documentaries are blacklisted except when belonging to a big international network (e.g. Netflix)
- Some networks are blacklisted (e.g. Disney XD)
- Older shows are blacklisted (oldest supported year is 2010)
- Certain languages from productive countries are blacklisted, unless the show is available on an international network (e.g. Netflix)
- Foreign (non-english) shows are blacklisted unless the first air date is recent, since they might become available internationally
- Popular shows are automatically whitelisted

This reduces the list of shows a little bit, but one central challenge remains: at the time where we need to decide whether
to white- or blacklist a tv show, not too much is known about it. Popularity or rating cannot be used as a factor yet,
because the first air date is still in the future. 

Currently, a manual review process is still in place, through the Filament admin.

```bash
just quality
```

Uses:

* phpstan

All detected issues **must be fixed**.

### Architecture Principles

Strictly follow:

* **KISS**
* **SOLID**
* **Clarity > cleverness**
* **Explicit code > compact code**

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v4
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/horizon (HORIZON) - v5
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- larastan/larastan (LARASTAN) - v3
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/telescope (TELESCOPE) - v5
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- rector/rector (RECTOR) - v2

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd at `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs. Never run commands to serve the site. It is always available.
- Use the `herd` CLI to manage services, PHP versions, and sites (e.g. `herd sites`, `herd services:start <service>`, `herd php:list`). Run `herd list` to discover all available commands.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan module:make-* {module}` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan module:make-class {name} {module}`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan module:make-model {name} {module}`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, etc.).

### URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan module:make-test [options] {name} {module}` to create a unit test, and pass `--feature` to create a feature test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev`.

### Laravel 12

Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->required()
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
    )),

TextInput::make('slug')
    ->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)->schema([
            TextInput::make('first_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('last_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('bio')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]),
    ]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('institution')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('qualification')
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Edit resource test" lang="php">
livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->fillForm(['name' => 'Updated'])
    ->call('save')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'id' => $user->id,
    'name' => 'Updated',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
  - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes
